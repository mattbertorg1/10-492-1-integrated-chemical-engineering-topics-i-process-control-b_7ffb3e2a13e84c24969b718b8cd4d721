| calc\_f.m ([M](/courses/chemical-engineering/10-492-1-integrated-chemical-engineering-topics-i-process-control-by-design-fall-2004/tools/calc_f.m)) | Contains a system of equations that describes the steady-state operation of a heat exchanger network. |
| calc\_Jac.m ([M](/courses/chemical-engineering/10-492-1-integrated-chemical-engineering-topics-i-process-control-by-design-fall-2004/tools/calc_Jac.m)) | Function to calculate the Jacobian matrix for a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. A simple central differencing scheme is used. |
| ice\_root.m ([M](/courses/chemical-engineering/10-492-1-integrated-chemical-engineering-topics-i-process-control-by-design-fall-2004/tools/ice_root.m)) | Calculates the RGA (relative gain array) and DC (disturbance cost) for the 10.492 heat exchanger network. |
| reduced\_Newton.m ([M](/courses/chemical-engineering/10-492-1-integrated-chemical-engineering-topics-i-process-control-by-design-fall-2004/tools/reduced_Newton.m)) | Uses a reduced-Newton algorithm with a weak line search to solve a set of non-linear algebraic equations.
